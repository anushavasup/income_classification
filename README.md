# income_classification
1.	Problem Statement:
	This classification model aims to identify individuals whose salary exceeds $50000. For this prediction, the model uses some demographic attributes such as age, level of education, sex, etc... From a business perspective, this can be used to target the right customers for specific products/services. This project will analyse a dataset containing information of individuals to create a classification model which is capable of identifying those whose salary exceeds a specified value ($50000). The dataset contains 32561 entries with 15 attributes.
2.      Result:
  In this study, i aimed to predict a personâ€™s income based on variables like workclass, education ,marital status, age, race, sex and others. Analysis provides information such as precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy of each model i applied. Based on my model analysis, Gradient Boosting Classifier shows the highest accuracy and f1 scores. 
So I will use it for further analysis.
